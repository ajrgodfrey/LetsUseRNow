# Let's Use R Now
### an e-book to support students, especially those who are blind, to use R effectively.


## Introduction 
This e-book has been posted on GitHub because there are two offers to translate sections into other languages. Instructions for doing so will be put in the file called NewLanguage.txt as a reference.

The GitHub repository was created on 2 June 2016 by Jonathan Godfrey; please send me a message if you intend to translate the work into a new language so I can be ready to help out when things aren't going so well. Use a.j.godfrey@massey.ac.nz 

## A note on completeness

The project has been worked on sporadically over the last six years, sometimes faster than I expect, often slower than I'd like. I know some sections are incomplete. If you feel there is room for you to help on some of the English sections then please do offer.

If you want to start a translation project, then again, please offer.



## Changes

### July 2016

- switched the Blind version to use mathjax for representing mathematical expressions. This is because screen reader support for mathematics has really grown over the last six months to a year and I am now ready to say that I am confident users can handle this content.
- made additions to offer more comments specifically targeted to the needs of the blind audience.
- some clean up to get the SVG links into the RChunk files that they belong to; this should have been done prior to upload to GitHub.
- removed some files containing nothing but white space; altered Make*Lang*.bat files accordingly.
- fixed error with \Blind
