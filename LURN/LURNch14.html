 id="x16-10900014"></a>Extending <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>beyond the base installation</h2>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >This chapter explains how you do some tasks that are not part of the basic
installation of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>. This includes instructions on how to add extra functionality via
add-on packages and pointers to some user interfaces.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1   </span> <a 
 id="x16-11000014.1"></a>Installing additional packages</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >Many <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users find that the vast range of functions that are built into the basic <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>
installation are not enough to meet their specific needs. <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>is relatively easy to
adapt to meet their needs because additional functions are easily created to
perform specific tasks.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   In order to let others use their creations, <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users often make their
functions available in add-on packages that can be downloaded by any <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>user.
The network of servers that store these packages is known as CRAN,
which is short for Comprehensive R Archive Network. There are over 8000
add-on packages currently available via CRAN as well as others that do
not meet the CRAN criteria. To make it to CRAN, an add-on package
must meet standards of presentation, quality of documentation, and be
available for all operating systems. Add-on packages that do not meet
these criteria do exist, especially those that are specific to one operating
system.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   Installing an add-on package requires two actions. First, you must ask <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>to
install a package of a certain name, either using the <a 
 id="dx16-110001"></a><span 
class="aett-12">install.packages()</span>
command or the Packages pull-down menu item.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   The second task is necessary only once in each <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>session. When you
go to install a package from CRAN, <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>will ask you to select a <a 
 id="dx16-110002"></a><span 
class="aeti-12">CRAN</span>
<span 
class="aeti-12">mirror</span>. This just wants you to choose which one of the servers scattered
around the world is the one you should point your internet connection
towards.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   These tasks are most commonly achieved by selecting the menu items and
associated dialogue boxes. If you do not want to use the dialogue box approach
for selecting a CRAN mirror, there is a text based alternative. If you
type
   <div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb327">  <a 
 id="x16-110004r1"></a><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;&#x003E;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;chooseCRANmirror(FALSE)</span></div>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >you will be given a list of the available CRAN mirrors and a different prompt.
Type in the number linked to the CRAN mirror you prefer and press
the Enter key. If you want to choose the first item on the list (which is
a cloud-based server anyway) then you could avoid reviewing the list
                                                                          

                                                                          
using:
   <div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb328">  <a 
 id="x16-110006r1"></a><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;&#x003E;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;chooseCRANmirror(ind=1)</span></div>
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Installation of individual packages can be achieved using the <a 
 id="dx16-110007"></a><span 
class="aett-12">install.packages()</span>
command. Investigate its help page to ensure you get the most out of its
use.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   One key argument for this command is <span 
class="aett-12">dependencies</span>. There are many
packages that rely on the work of other packages for their success. It&#8217;s probably a
good idea to get into the habit of installing all dependent packages. For
example:
   <div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb329">  <a 
 id="x16-110009r1"></a><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;&#x003E;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;install.packages("Dodge",</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;dependencies=TRUE)</span></div>
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >which will install the <a 
 id="dx16-110010"></a><span 
class="aeti-12">Dodge </span>package. If this package used another package that was
not currently installed on your machine, that package would also have been
downloaded and installed.
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.2   </span> <a 
 id="x16-11100014.2"></a>Updating add-on packages</h3>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >If you want to be sure you have the latest version of the packages you have
downloaded are being used, then every once in a while you should issue the
command
   <div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb330">  <a 
 id="x16-111002r1"></a><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;&#x003E;</span><span 
class="aett-12">&#x00A0;update.packages(ask=FALSE)</span></div>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Note that the <span 
class="aett-12">ask </span>argument is set to <span 
class="aett-12">FALSE </span>here. The default action is to ask the user
if they want a particular package updated. I find this frustrating, especially if it&#8217;s
been a while since I updated my packages.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   You do not need to do this task very often. I would recommend doing it after
installing a new version of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>, or if you see a warning message about the version of
a package you use.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Finally, note that if you have not established a connection with a CRAN
mirror in the current <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>session, then you will be prompted to do so before
anything is downloaded.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.3   </span> <a 
 id="x16-11200014.3"></a>Using an enhanced graphical interface</h3>
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >The base installation of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>doesn&#8217;t offer much statistical functionality in its menu
system (assuming you use one!). Various projects are under development that
enhance the way users can interact with <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Perhaps the most well-known is the <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>Commander project. This interface
has been given a lot of development over a number of years now and
can support the needs of most introductory level statistical analyses. Its
implementation is via the <a 
 id="dx16-112001"></a><span 
class="aeti-12">Rcmdr </span>add-on package downloadable from
CRAN.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   I don&#8217;t use this package as it is more suited to novice to intermediate <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users.
It also creates a host of new functions that improve on similar functions included
in base <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>that I don&#8217;t need. The idea of working with mouse clicks is
counter-intuitive to reproducible research ideas that most medium to advanced <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>
users like.
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.4   </span> <a 
 id="x16-11300014.4"></a>Use of an integrated development environment (IDE)</h3>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >The best integrated development environment (IDE) for <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users is <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>Studio. Some
people find this way of working to be a bewildering experience. Others
love the convenience of having each project contained in a structured
environment.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   My advice for anyone wanting to use RStudio or any new IDE is to find
someone to give you a hands-on demonstration. Perhaps watching videos from the
internet are a useful alternative, but you need to know that this tool is what you
need before investing time in its use.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Be warned: RStudio is a very powerful and useful tool for even the
most advanced <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users. As such, it can be too much for the novice <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>
user.
