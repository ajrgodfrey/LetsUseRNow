class="aess-12">R </span>Blind</h2>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >OK. Cards on the table here. I am blind. Many people know this and perhaps
that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve obtained this document in the first place. I use <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>as my
software of preference because I find it the most useful tool available to me; partly
because I am blind, partly because of the work I do as a lecturer. I have used
other packages like SAS and SPlus with almost as much success, Minitab and
SPSS with differing levels of success (mostly depending on the version of
that software), and have tried a number of other options with little or no
success.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   I do use Microsoft EXCEL at times, but not for doing the tasks described in
this document. I do not regard EXCEL as statistical software but do use it to do
some basic calculations and for editing large data sets. To this extent, EXCEL is
just an example of a spreadsheet application and has no advantage or
disadvantage over any other spreadsheet application. They are therefore all as
equally useful/useless to me.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   My software experiences have all been gained as a blind person. I had some
useful vision for handling print while I was an undergraduate but I found using
low-vision software was slower than operating as a blind person. Some of what
follows might prove useful to people using software which enlarges the screen&#8217;s
contents but I have had little opportunity to test any low-vision software
applications. I would, of course, be interested in learning how anyone using
low-vision software gets on using <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>but the first two users I have worked
with were running <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>quite easily. The low-vision user of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>can choose
whether operating as a sighted or blind user is better for them so reading
through this chapter may prove important if they are to make the best
choice.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   The material that follows in this chapter has been tested by blind users of
<span 
class="aess-12">R </span>on all three operating systems mentioned here. I am grateful to the
organizers of the second Summer University of the ICCHP, held in the Czech
Republic from 29 July to 3 August 2011. This gave me an opportunity to
showcase <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>to a wide audience of blind students from many European
countries, and to verify the usefulness of the software on platforms other than
Windows.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   If you&#8217;re a sighted user of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>and want to know how your blind student is going
to get on, you need to talk to them. It might help to read on, but it is going to be
much more use if the blind student solves as many of their problems themselves &#8212;
perhaps with your supervision and assistance.
                                                                          

                                                                          
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x4-60002.1"></a>Screen readers</h3>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Blind people use screen reading software to listen to what gets printed on the
screen. Screen readers are good at processing text and generally less useful when a
picture or graph needs to be described. I use a product known as JAWS,
but other commercial screen readers should work equally well with <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>; I
also test the usefulness of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>with one open source screen reader called
NVDA. JAWS is a Windows application. Few blind people are serious
MacIntosh users, but some are taking up Linux as their operating system of
choice. The screen reader in many Linux distributions is called ORCA,
and Macintosh users have VoiceOver as part of the standard operating
system.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   This document assumes the blind user has a good working knowledge of their
screen reader and operating system. Most of us know where to find help with our
screen reader problems, and in any case the solution I have for using <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>as a blind
person requires little more than the basic knowledge for either screen reader or the
Windows operating system.
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x4-70002.2"></a><span 
class="aess-12">R </span>and braille displays</h3>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >A braille display provides the blind user with information in refreshable braille.
The equipment that gets connected to the user&#8217;s computer is certainly not cheap
but can make access to otherwise printed information available to the blind user
so that there can be little confusion about the syntax of commands or output.
Many blind programmers I have spoken with, swear by their braille display for
giving them true access to the printed word. Sound from screen readers is
wonderful, but there are opportunities to make mistakes when relying on sound
alone.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   At the 2011 Summer University I was able to see how students using a braille
display could use <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>. The results were very pleasing indeed. The Windows
users with braille displays relied on their screen reader to provide the
information to the user via the braille display and as the screen readers
were working well with <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>already, the access was further improved with
braille.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   A Linux user at the Summer University was able to make use of his braille
display without explicitly using a screen reader. The interesting aspect to this
discovery was that this means <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>is available to the deaf-blind user as
well.
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   I still need to learn how well the braille display would work with <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>on a Mac,
                                                                          

                                                                          
but expect the experiment would show similarly pleasing outcomes.
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x4-80002.3"></a>Setting up <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>as a blind Windows user</h3>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >Most <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users install the software and run it as the default installation allows. The
main file that is executed is called &#8220;rgui.exe" but in spite of its name, little of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>&#8217;s
use is found within the graphical user interface (GUI). Most <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users operate by
either typing commands one at a time or by executing a whole bunch of
commands together. In either case, the commands are all generated by typing
standard text somewhere. Standard text is of course totally accessible to the blind
user.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   The standard <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>application window is not accessible to the blind user. We can
hear a command being typed in but can&#8217;t hear what gets returned. This
behaviour is somewhat strange as the sighted user sees what appears to
be plain text on screen. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not plain text and it&#8217;s also
not easy to explain. Please send an email if you want a more detailed
explanation of the phenomenon. The most reassuring thing about the way a
screen reader interacts with the &#8220;rgui.exe" application is that when you
try to close the application using <span 
class="aett-12">ALT+F4</span>, JAWS will actually speak the
dialogue perfectly well. It is in fact the only dialogue that works this
well.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Obviously, it&#8217;s not all bad news. <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>does come with a terminal window system
and this is accessible; it&#8217;s actually what the Linux user gets anyway! This terminal
has the look and feel of a standard command prompt window that many users will
be familiar with. This window is where all text is entered and where all
non-graphical output will be printed. Your screen reader will speak the contents of
the terminal window as output is added.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The default installation of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>places a shortcut on the desktop. Once
you&#8217;ve installed <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>in the default way, you will need to edit this shortcut&#8217;s
properties. Find it, hit &#8220;ALT+Enter" and make sure you are on the dialogue
box that is for the target file. The full path is given here and the last
element is &#8220;rgui.exe". Change this last bit to read &#8220;rterm.exe" and hit
OK.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   Test it now. The shortcut should run <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>in a terminal window which looks like
a DOS window. You will hear an introduction message about <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>and ultimately the
prompt which is a greater than symbol. To get out of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>, we need to type <span 
class="aett-12">q() </span>and
answer a question about saving the workspace. This should all be heard if things
are going correctly. Note: your answer needs to be followed by hitting the enter
key.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Change in software is inevitable and <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>does undergo changes all the time.
When version 2.10.0 came out the standard functionality of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>&#8217;s help was
fundamentally altered. In version 2.9.2 and before, typing <span 
class="aett-12">?Mean </span>would open an
internet browser with the help page. This was very readable by screen reader
software. In version 2.10.0, this default behaviour changed. In version 2.10.1
however the developers fixed the problem. We expect this problem not to arise
again, but just in case here is the solution.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   If for some reason, the help functionality doesn&#8217;t work as we suggest, you can
force the html help pages to be displayed by performing the following task. You
will need to find the folder where <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>was installed. It should be in the &#8220;Program
Files" folder if you installed using the default settings when you installed <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>. We
are looking for a file called <span 
class="aett-12">Rprofile.site</span>; it is in the &#8220;etc" folder. Open this file
in your favourite text editor. We are looking for a line that contains the text
<span 
class="aett-12">options(help_type="html")</span>. If there is a hash or number sign (call it what you
will) at the beginning of the line, it will stop the command from being
executed. Remove the character so that the line starts with <span 
class="aett-12">options</span>. Save the
file.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   If you&#8217;ve changed the shortcut on the desktop and checked the options for
html help, then open <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>and type <span 
class="aett-12">?mean</span>. You should be able to see full html style
help complete with the ability to link to other help pages.

 id="x4-90002.3.1"></a>Solution for the problem of the screen reader losing focus</h4>
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >I have encountered a problem where the screen reader loses focus when using the
terminal window. This happened under both Windows Vista and Windows 7
using the JAWS screen reader. For more than two years, my only solution was to
use the original RGui form of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>, and learn to redirect your output to an external
file. See Sections&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x4-130002.6">2.6<!--tex4ht:ref: GettingTheMost --></a> and&#x00A0;<a 
href="LURNch9.html#x11-690009.4">9.4<!--tex4ht:ref: TextSink --></a> which present a way of gaining access to the output.
It is still a good idea to look at the suggested material, but a solution has come to
hand.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   In January 2014, Dr Robert Erhardt (Assistant Professor of Mathematics at
Wake Forest University) contacted me with a solution. His suggestion is to
hit the <span 
class="aett-12">ALT </span>key when the focus gets lost. I&#8217;ve tested this with JAWS&#x00A0;14
and NVDA with R&#x00A0;3.0.2 running under Windows&#x00A0;7 and it worked for
me.

<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >In May 2014 I learnt how to install <span

the installation file, I created a batch file with the single line <span 
class="aett-12">R-3.1.0-win.exe</span>
<span 
class="aett-12">/silent </span>that I put in the same folder. This single line is what could be typed in
at a command prompt to get <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>installed silently. Usin a batch file means that
when the next version of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>comes out, I will only need to change the version
number in the filename.

<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >If you&#8217;re reading this section I assume you know how to work using a Mac. The
following instructions were provided to me by Bram Duvigneau(a blind Mac user
himself) at the Summer University in 2011, who had read this document and then
given me some pointers to share.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Like Windows users, Mac users will find the screen reader for Mac works
better if you use the terminal version of <span

Having obtained the installer for the Mac from CRAN, follow the following

<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >If you&#8217;re reading this section I assume you know how to work in Linux. This
means you know how you will obtain the installer for <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>yourself. Further I assume
you know how your screen reader works.
                                                                          

                                                                          
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Once you&#8217;ve downloaded the installer and installed <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>, you should
be able to run it by typing &#8220;<span

really.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Many installations of Linux offer the user the opportunity to install directly so
that the download step is not explicitly required.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   I have witnessed (first-hand) a blind Linux user operate <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>without the speech
synthesis turned on. His comfort in Linux with a braille display alone was
sufficient.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   There are a number of reasons why I&#8217;d like to be using Linux and
<span 
class="aess-12">R </span>one day. Chief among these is the ability to set up each <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>script file
as an executable file that will run without needing to actually open <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>
itself.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Linux users have a much greater range of options available to them for
improving the accessibility of any software. Re-direction of output from an <span

session is an example.

 id="x4-130002.6"></a>Getting the most out of the <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>window</h3>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >In this case I actually mean getting anything out of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>! Windows users of screen
readers will find it difficult to copy and paste any output from <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>for insertion into
a document. The solution is to create a text file that contains the output from the
current session.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   Use of the <a 
 id="dx4-13001"></a><span 
class="aett-12">sink() </span>command is explained in Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="LURNch9.html#x11-690009.4">9.4<!--tex4ht:ref: TextSink --></a>. For the blind user,
this text file can be the means by which we gain access to <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>output as it is
created, albeit in a different window. Better ways of working do exist. This
suggestion is great for users who must work interactively with an open <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>session.
Improved functionality for doing this is discussed in Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="LURNch15.html#x17-11400015.1">15.1<!--tex4ht:ref: CreateCopyConsole --></a>, but if a blind
user can move to working with <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>in batch mode (one way or another) life will get
even easier.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Once the sink is in place, the blind user opens the text file that is being
created (and continuously updated) in their preferred browser. After a set of
commands that would normally print output in the terminal/console window have
been issued, the blind user only needs to refresh the browser so that the latest
output appears.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   The result is that the output appears in the sink file if the command was
successfully issued. Warning and error messages are printed in the terminal
window and are read aloud by the screen reader. Users of the <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>console window
will need to review the screen to see why nothing was added to the sink
file.

 id="x4-140002.7"></a>More advanced ways of running <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>programs</h3>
<!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >Sometimes we will want to run a series of commands. Typing out lots of
commands can prove tedious and to be honest no sighted <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>user does it by issuing
commands via the command line one at a time.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>does have its own script window that the GUI version uses. In that
window users edit the set of commands they want to run. Sometimes
it&#8217;s easier to obtain the code we want from another <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>program we used
before, or by copying commands from an alternate source. <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users often
share programs and re-run them locally. Opening a <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>program in the
script window of the GUI version of <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>, is an option available to the blind
user but the outputs from running commands all gets pumped into the
main console window where the screen reader may not be able to read it
all.
<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >   The most advanced users of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>who have large jobs to run will run them on
another computer, and it is from this approach that my favourite method of
running my <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>programs was developed.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   All necessary commands are typed up in a standard text file. <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>command files
are often given the single capital letter R as their extension but they are just plain
text files, editable in any text editor program you choose.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   For the moment, assume a valid set of commands has been placed in the file
<span 
class="aett-12">testing.R</span> and this file has been placed in your working directory. You can see
how the sighted <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>user runs batch jobs and the use of multiple working directories
in Chapter&#x00A0;<a 
href="LURNch10.html#x12-7100010">10<!--tex4ht:ref: GoodIdeas --></a> on what I think are good ideas.
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   My first approach uses what the geeks call &#8220;piping". We pipe our set of
commands into <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>and pipe out all output to a text file. This is done using a batch
file. Batch files are just text files themselves, with commands that are
issued in a DOS window, sometimes known as the command prompt. All
we need to do is create a new text file and give it the name we want.
This text file will have just one command in it which will look something
like
                                                                          

                                                                          
   <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-1">
"c:\program&#x00A0;files\r\r-3.0.2\i386\bin\rterm.exe"&#x00A0;--no-save&#x00A0;&#x003C;&#x00A0;testing.R&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;testing.Rout
</div>
<!--l. 116--><p class="nopar" > You&#8217;ll need to edit this command to suit your installation, especially the
full path to the executable file which will also depend on your operating
system.
<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   When you save this file, it can be called whatever you like but needs to have
the <span 
class="aett-12">bat </span>extension. I tend to keep the files together with the same name so would
recommend <span 
class="aett-12">testing.bat</span>Just clicking on it in windows explorer runs the file, its
single command, and therefore the commands in the <span 
class="aett-12">testing.R</span> file. All output is
then printed in the <span 
class="aett-12">testing.Rout</span> file including the commands you issued.
The output file is just plain text and can be opened in a text editor or
browser.
<!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s certainly not essential that you come to grips with using the batch file
approach to run <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>in the background. It is fairly essential that you are
comfortable writing up the <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>commands in a text file and pulling them into <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>
using the <a 
 id="dx4-14001"></a><span 
class="aett-12">source() </span>command if you intend doing more than just simple
jobs.
<!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >   For the time-being, my recommendation is to run <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>using the terminal
window until you gain some confidence in its operation. Come back to the
batch file approach once you know that <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>is going to do what you need
done.
