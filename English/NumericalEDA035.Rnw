Often, \R{} will allow arguments to be abbreviated. Unfortunately, this isn't the case for this additional argument. It is the case for choosing the preferred correlation measure to be found though. The default is to calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient. My personal preference is to use both this measure and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as it does not require the relationship to be linear, nor does it require the samples to be normally distributed. As well as finding Spearman's measure, I've decided that printing correlations to five decimal places is unnecessary so have restricted the output using the \Rcmd{round} command.
