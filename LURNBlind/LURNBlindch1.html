<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="aess-12">R </span>is a statistical programming language and environment. The up-front learning
curve is somewhat steeper than other statistical software systems as <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>does not
have the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that other packages have; browsing the
menus for inspiration is not an option.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   This means that <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>is best suited to users who know what they want, or in
educational situations where students are encouraged to know what they want
before they play around in a particular application. The difficulty most
people will have when encountering <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>is that knowing what you want is
different to knowing how to get what you want. This manual is aimed at
developing a set of instructions for doing tasks that might be required in all
introductory statistics courses &#8212; basic data analysis, manipulation and
presentation. It is not intended to be a comprehensive textbook although some
theory might be thrown in to help explain particular topics when this is
necessary.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   This collection should be useful as a reference guide; it might be useful as a
series of tasks for undergraduate learning but is not specifically intended for that
purpose. If there is something you think you want to do that isn&#8217;t here let me
know and I will endeavour to add it into the next iteration.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   I&#8217;ve tried to keep the order of topics fairly linear, but to be honest it&#8217;s difficult
to talk about some things in such a constrained order. Most chapters will state
what is assumed before the chapter is worked through. For example, if it&#8217;s a
simple matter of loading the data then it&#8217;s done on the spot, assuming the reader
can work out what is happening for themselves. The index is therefore
an invaluable resource for finding where commands were introduced or
explained in greater detail. This means that jumping around should be
possible. In the end, skipping chapters and sections of little interest is
advisable; there is so much you could learn about using <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>. You should
avoid getting bogged down by unimportant topics; note they are there
and move on. There&#8217;s always time to come back if you find you need to
later.

<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >OK, lets assume that you&#8217;ve got this manual because you also have <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>and are
                                                                          

                                                                          
ready to go. If you haven&#8217;t installed <span 
class="aess-12">R</span>, then please do, and if you really know little
about how to choose the best options for the questions that get asked during the
installation, choose the default answer. I install new versions of <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>as they become
available, and happily use the default settings without any downstream pain and
suffering.

class="aess-12">R</span></h3>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="aess-12">R </span>is a collaborative project and development is ongoing. Most users do not
need to update <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>with the release of every new version. I recommend
staying with one <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>version for as long as you can. I only change versions to
keep up with the latest version my students might be using and because
some of the additional packages created by other <span 
class="aess-12">R </span>users are built on
recent versions. I also ask that my students start a semester with the
most current release so that they are on the same page as all of their
classmates.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   As it happens, this manual was compiled using version 3.4.0 which was
released on 12 December, 2016. All code should work on other versions equally
well. Please report any faults with the code to the author. Be warned though that
if it works for me then it might be because you have an antiquated version of
<span 
class="aess-12">R</span>!
